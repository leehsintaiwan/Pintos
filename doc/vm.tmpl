We use a struct page to keep track of the frame address for that particular page.
So we can just return the frame address stored in the struct.

We defined a "lock" field (a struct lock) in the frame_table struct. This lock is acquired whenever 
a user process attempts to access a frame in the frame table in any way (add, get, destroy, lookup), and released only after the frame table 
has been accessed (and potentially modified). This prevents two user processes accessing the frame table simultaneously, thus avoiding races.
Even if there are no free frames in the table, when we evict a frame we still lock the frame table before eviction and release after eviction to avoid races.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> Why did you choose the data structure(s) that you did for representing the

We chose to implement our supplemental page table and frame table by using a hash table,
because hash tables support efficient lookup, insertion and deletion.
Frequent adding and deleting a page and frame is necessary therefore we refrained
from using a list.

             MEMORY MAPPED FILES
             ===================

typedef int mapid_t;

typedef is used to distinguish between a mapping id and a normal int

struct md
   {
      mapid_t id;
      struct list_elem elem;
      struct file* file;
      void *addr;
      size_t size;
   };

A struct containing the information of a map descriptor,
including its mapping id, pointer to the file, where the file is mapped to and the file size

struct thread now contains a list of memory mapped files, given by the field:
struct list *mmap_list;

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: (3 marks)
>> Explain how you determine whether a new file mapping overlaps with any 
>> existing segment and how you handle such a case.

Before we map the files, we check if those pages are already mapped by using a for loop to go through the pages
and check if they have already been mapped with find_page().
If find_page() returns something that is not null at any point in the for loop, this means the new file mapping will
overlap with an existing set of mapped pages so we release the lock and release -1 to indicate a failure.
